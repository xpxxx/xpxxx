### Hi there 👋 I'm Peixuan

I work at the intersection of **Software Engineering (SE)** and **AI**, with a focus on making **LLM-assisted software development** more **reliable, reproducible, and scalable**—especially for **cross-file code changes** and **repository-level workflows**.

Right now, I’m particularly interested in **structured “agent instruction” documentation** (e.g., *CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / project rules*) and how SE techniques like **ADR, C4/arc42 architecture documentation, and interface/contract specs** can strengthen these artifacts to improve correctness and reduce rework.

- 🔭 **Current focus:** Empirical research on **LLM coding assistants** for **cross-file modifications** (effectiveness, generalisability, failure modes)
- 🧪 **Methods & interests:** Empirical SE, repo mining, benchmark-driven evaluation (e.g., Repo-level tasks), failure analysis, tooling/protocol design
- 🧰 **Also exploring:** RAG reliability (evaluation, retrieval/grounding, guardrails) and practical agent pipelines
- 💬 Ask me about **SE × LLMs**, repo-level evaluation, structured documentation protocols, or building reliable LLM tooling
- 📫 Reach me: **PeixuanXia@gmail.com**
- 😄 Pronouns: **She/Her**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love traveling—especially places with great local food and culture

If you're interested in collaborating on **AI for SE** / **SE for AI**, feel free to reach out!
